# Hackathon--Love-Maker-Chrome-Extention
This is my first ever Hackathon and I had a wonderful time learning Web Dev!
- I learned about using the APIs and how to use the fetch method via GET/POST to send and receive requests from the client to the server
- Not all APIs will be approved/connected. For example, LinkedIn's API needs approval to use.
- Shout out to my partner Ron for figuring things out with me!
